# DbDataProxy

An Apache Arrow Flight SQL proxy for relational databases. Clients speak standard Arrow Flight SQL to the proxy;
the proxy runs their queries against existing databases through ODBC or an ADO.NET provider and streams the results
back as Arrow record batches, **compressed**. Its main job is shrinking result sets on the wire, but it does not
dictate how you use it.

* .NET 10, Kestrel, runs as a Windows service (also systemd/Docker). Windows Server 2016+ is supported.
  IIS is not used: gRPC over IIS needs HTTP/2 response trailers, which Windows Server 2016 IIS lacks.
* Standalone: a self-contained single-file `DbDataProxy.exe` that generates its own self-signed TLS certificate.

## Quick start

```powershell
./build/publish.ps1                 # -> artifacts/publish/win-x64 (DbDataProxy.exe + worker\)
cd artifacts/publish/win-x64
./DbDataProxy.exe hash-password     # prompts; paste the hash into appsettings.json
# edit appsettings.json (see appsettings.example.json), then:
./DbDataProxy.exe                   # run in a console
./DbDataProxy.exe install           # or register the Windows service (elevated prompt), then: sc start DbDataProxy
./DbDataProxy.exe query --insecure --user me --password ... --datasource erp --sql "SELECT 1"
```

On first start the proxy writes `dbdataproxy-selfsigned.pfx` and `.cer` to its data directory
(`%ProgramData%\DbDataProxy` by default, `Proxy:DataDirectory` to change). Import the `.cer` into clients that
should trust it. The certificate covers localhost, the machine name/FQDN and `Proxy:Tls:Hostnames`, and is
regenerated automatically when those change or it nears expiry. Use `Tls:Mode = File` for your own PFX.

## Releases and installation

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) builds, tests and smoke-packages every push and pull request on a Windows runner.
Pushing a tag such as `v1.2.3` runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which tests, runs `build/package.ps1` and creates a
GitHub release containing `DbDataProxy-<version>-win-x64.zip`, `SHA256SUMS` and `install.ps1` (tags containing `-`,
such as `v1.2.3-rc1`, are marked as pre-releases).

To install or upgrade from a release, run from an elevated PowerShell prompt:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest/download/install.ps1))) -Repo <owner>/<repo> -InstallService
```

The script verifies the download against `SHA256SUMS`, installs to `%ProgramFiles%\DbDataProxy` (`-InstallDir`),
keeps an existing `appsettings.json`, stops and restarts a running service around an upgrade, and registers the
service only with `-InstallService`. `-Version 1.2.3` selects a specific release. Edit the `$Repo` default in
`scripts/install.ps1` to your repository to make `-Repo` unnecessary.

## Configuration

`appsettings.json` beside the executable, environment variables (`DBPROXY_Proxy__Listen__Port=9000`) or command
line (`--Proxy:Listen:Port=9000`). `appsettings.example.json` documents every option. Users, data sources,
compression and auth settings reload without a restart; the listener and certificate need one.

### Data sources

Clients never send connection strings. They name a configured data source with the `x-datasource` call header
(optional when the user has a default or exactly one permitted source).

| Provider | Notes |
|---|---|
| `sqlserver` | Microsoft.Data.SqlClient |
| `duckdb` | DuckDB.NET (handy for local testing) |
| `odbc` | System.Data.Odbc. `"Bitness": "x86"` runs the query in the 32-bit worker process |

Other ADO.NET providers: implement `IDbProvider` and register it. Statements are read-only unless the data
source sets `"AllowWrites": true` (this only gates statements sent as *updates*; the database account's own
permissions are the real boundary for what a query can do).

Types map to Arrow as: integers/floats/bool directly (`tinyint` → UInt8), `decimal` → Decimal128 (precision/scale
from the provider, default 38/9 when unknown), `date` → Date32, `datetime/datetime2` → Timestamp(µs),
`datetimeoffset` → Timestamp(µs, UTC), `time` → Time64(µs), strings/GUIDs/anything else → Utf8, `varbinary` → Binary.
ODBC columns of types `System.Data.Odbc` cannot read (e.g. SQL Server `datetimeoffset`/`time` through ODBC) fail
with a message telling you to `CAST` them in the query.

### Compression

`Proxy:Compression` (global) and `DataSources:<name>:Compression` (override):

| Mode | Codec | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `None` | | | |
| `Grpc` | `gzip` | **gRPC compression**: the transport compresses each whole message | Any gRPC client that advertises gzip; weaker ratio |
| `Arrow` | `zstd` / `lz4` | **Arrow data compression**: each column buffer inside the Arrow stream is compressed | Best ratio on columnar data; the client's Arrow reader must support the codec |

Clients can override per call with the `x-compression` header (`none`, `gzip`, `zstd`, `lz4`) unless
`AllowClientOverride` is false. Standard Arrow clients (C++/Python/Java/Go) read Arrow data compression natively (it is part of the Arrow format, so no gRPC negotiation is involved).
The stock .NET Flight client does not, which is why this repo ships `DbDataProxy.Client.ProxyFlightClient`.

> Arrow data compression relies on setting writer/reader options that `Apache.Arrow.Flight` 23.0.0 only exposes
> through non-public members. The proxy verifies they exist at startup and fails fast rather than silently sending
> uncompressed data; tests guard it. If that ever breaks on a package upgrade, use `Grpc` mode until it is fixed.

### Authentication

Everything arrives as a Flight call; the proxy denies any call without valid credentials (except the handshake).

1. **Local users with hashed passwords** (`Proxy:Users`, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 210k iterations). Standard Flight
   handshake: Basic credentials in, opaque bearer token out (`authorization: Bearer ...` response header). Each user
   lists the data sources they may use; the data source's connection string carries the database credentials
   ("mapped" accounts). Failed logins are throttled per user and client address.
2. **Windows accounts** (`"AuthType": "Windows"`, Windows only): same handshake, but the password is checked
   against the local/domain account (`DOMAIN\user`, `user@domain`, or a bare local name) and the user maps to
   data sources like any other.
3. **Pass-through database credentials** (`"PassThrough": true` on a data source): the username/password the
   client authenticates with are injected into that connection and the database is the authority, so a wrong
   password fails at query time. Local users always win over pass-through for the same name.
4. **JWT bearer / OIDC** (`Proxy:Auth:Jwt`, e.g. Microsoft Entra ID): clients send `authorization: Bearer <jwt>` on
   every call. Validated against the authority's keys (or a shared HMAC key); `Mappings` turn claims (`groups`,
   `roles`, `scp`, ...) into data-source access. Tokens matching no mapping are refused.

Always run with TLS (`SelfSigned` or `File`) outside local testing: credentials are sent as Basic auth.

### 32-bit ODBC

A 64-bit process cannot load 32-bit drivers, so `Bitness: "x86"` ODBC sources are executed by
`DbDataProxy.Worker.exe` (published `win-x86`, in `worker\`). The proxy starts it on first use, talks to it over a
loopback Flight connection guarded by a random per-launch secret, restarts it if it dies and stops it with the
service; the worker also exits if the proxy disappears. If you publish the whole proxy as `win-x86`
(`./build/publish.ps1 -Runtime win-x86`) the sources run in-process and no worker is needed.

## Clients

C# (`DbDataProxy.Client`, in `DbDataProxy.Core`):

```csharp
using var client = new ProxyFlightClient("https://proxy:8815");
await client.AuthenticateAsync("me", "password");
var result = await client.QueryAsync("SELECT * FROM sales",
    new QueryOptions { DataSource = "erp", Compression = "zstd" });
await foreach (var batch in result) { /* Apache.Arrow.RecordBatch */ }
```

Other languages use their normal Flight SQL client. With ADBC (Python shown; the same options exist for the other
languages):

```python
import adbc_driver_flightsql.dbapi as fsql
from adbc_driver_flightsql import DatabaseOptions

conn = fsql.connect("grpc+tls://proxy:8815", db_kwargs={
    "username": "me", "password": "...",
    DatabaseOptions.RPC_CALL_HEADER_PREFIX.value + "x-datasource": "erp",
    DatabaseOptions.RPC_CALL_HEADER_PREFIX.value + "x-compression": "zstd",   # optional
})
```

With plain pyarrow Flight: `token = client.authenticate_basic_token(user, pw)` then pass
`FlightCallOptions(headers=[token, (b"x-datasource", b"erp")])` to `get_flight_info` / `do_get`.

ADBC (Python, Go driver) and pyarrow Flight are exercised by `tests/interop/run-interop.ps1` against the published
exe: queries with every compression setting, updates, metadata and wrong-password rejection all pass.

## Not supported yet

* Prepared-statement parameters, `GetExportedKeys`/`GetImportedKeys`/`GetCrossReference` and `GetXdbcTypeInfo`.
  Plain statements and parameterless prepared statements work (the .NET client prepares everything).
* Catalog metadata: SQL Server and DuckDB sources are read from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`. ODBC sources use the driver's
  catalog API (`SQLTables`, via `GetSchema`), so text/Excel/Access and other drivers without `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` work,
  including through the 32-bit worker. Set a data source's `"Metadata"` to `"odbc"` or `"informationschema"` to
  override the default (`"auto"`). Per-table schemas quote names with the driver's own identifier character and fall
  back to shorter names when the driver's catalog is not valid SQL. ODBC sources report no primary keys.
* `AllowWrites` only gates statements a client sends as *updates*. A client that runs `INSERT`/`DDL` through the query
  path (ADBC's `cursor.execute` does) is limited only by the database account's permissions, so use read-only database
  accounts for read-only sources.
* Transactions, `DoPut` bulk ingestion.
* Pass-through and Windows-account logon have not been exercised against real accounts.
* The Linux/Docker path (`Dockerfile`) has not been built or run in this repository's environment.

## Development

```powershell
dotnet test            # unit + end-to-end tests (DuckDB; SQL Server tests skip when .\SQLEXPRESS is unreachable)
```

The tests publish the 32-bit worker on demand into `artifacts/worker-x86` and use the 32-bit-only Microsoft Text ODBC
driver to prove queries really run in a 32-bit process. Set `DBPROXY_TEST_SQLSERVER` to point the SQL Server tests at
another instance (Windows authentication).

Layout: `src/DbDataProxy.Core` (Arrow conversion, ADO.NET executor, client, worker protocol),
`src/DbDataProxy.Server` (Kestrel host, Flight SQL server, auth, TLS, service/CLI),
`src/DbDataProxy.Worker` (32-bit ODBC worker), `tests/DbDataProxy.Tests`.
